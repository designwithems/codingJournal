**Line 39 Global scope and functions  

/* Global scope means they can be seen everywhere in your Javascript code

Variable which are defined outside of a function block have global scope*/

**Line 65 Local scope and functions

/* Local Scope and functions

means only visible w/in a function, if you're trying to access a variable win a function it won't allow you*/

**Line 74 Global vs Local scope

// in the scenario where you had to use a name that was already used outside the function, the one u use locally will persevere if you intend to print the object/function
/* now in the case u use a variable outside the function the one that will show up is the one that has global function example */

**Line 438 
* eme-notes: pag dating sa object properties, dapat ano na ayusin mo paggamit ng data type syntax chuchu.

-Don't forget to use "" for texts  
-For integers they'll work just fine.
-Pwede mong gamitin outside yung local property at ipasok sa isang global variable.
-Ang Catch kasi na try ko di lagyan ng "" ang nangyari di ko ma lagay sa isang bagong variable yung property.

/*Another helpful tip for the future, use syntax and namingSense to have a cleaner and understandable code.  It's much better to make an array of texts or numbers that you want to print/console.log for simpler coding.
